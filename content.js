      "Follow Ari, a young girl on the run who ends up in Anapoda, a colony suspended in the sky. She meets Estrilda, a well-known freelancer, and the Antumbra team, a start-up freelancer group. Follow their journey as they face various challenges and uncover secrets of this world, as well as their own.",
      "Antumbra is a passion project that was originally created by us, Holy and Maiko, who are artists ourselves. We have been writing the story for few years, and we decided that we want to share our project to the world by publishing Antumbra as a manga. That's when we build up our own studio with aspiring artists who are passionate in creating this manga."

      "We're Aftermath Studios - basically a bunch of freelance artists who love manga and decided to team up! Founded by Holy and Maiko in 2024 when we started working on Antumbra, we're now a group of creators from all over the place working together to make awesome stories and art that we're genuinely excited about.",
      "Antumbra is our big project right now, and honestly, it's been amazing seeing what happens when artists with different skills come together. We've got character artists, background wizards, storytellers - everyone bringing their own flavor to the mix. We all work from wherever we are, which is pretty cool.",
      "The best part? Everyone keeps their creative freedom while working on something bigger together. We're not your typical studio - we're more like a group of artist friends making the manga we want to see in the world."
