      "Follow Ari, a young girl on the run who ends up in Anapoda, a colony suspended in the sky. She meets Estrilda, a well-known freelancer, and the Antumbra team, a start-up freelancer group. Follow their journey as they face various challenges and uncover secrets of this world, as well as their own.",
      "Antumbra is a passion project that was originally created by us, Holy and Maiko, who are artists ourselves. We have been writing the story for few years, and we decided that we want to share our project to the world by publishing Antumbra as a manga. That's when we build up our own studio with aspiring artists who are passionate in creating this manga."
